What is a Database?
A database is a place where we store data in an organized way so we can find and use it easily. 

What is Normalization?
Normalization means organizing the data to avoid repetition and keep it clean.

1NF (First Normal Form):
Make sure each field has one value only (no lists).
✅ Good: Subject = "Math"
❌ Bad: Subject = "Math, English"

2NF (Second Normal Form):
Be in 1NF + all non-key data depends on the full primary key (no partial dependency).

3NF (Third Normal Form):
Be in 2NF + non-key data shouldn't depend on other non-key data (no transitive dependency).
